    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `open()` function is used to open a file. It takes two main parameters: the file path (either a relative or absolute path to the file) and the mode in which the file should be opened. The syntax for the `open()` function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `file` is the file path, and `mode` is the mode in which the file should be opened. The `mode` parameter is optional, and if not specified, the default mode is `'r'` (read-only mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different modes for opening a file in Python, each serving a different purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **'r' (Read Mode)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "   - If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'r')`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **'w' (Write Mode)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'w')`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **'a' (Append Mode)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'a')`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **'b' (Binary Mode)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files (e.g., images, executables). This mode should be used in conjunction with other modes.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.bin', 'rb')`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **'+' (Read/Write Mode)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'r+')`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **'x' (Exclusive Creation Mode)**:\n",
    "   - Creates a new file and opens it for writing. If the file already exists, the operation fails.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'x')`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **'t' (Text Mode)**:\n",
    "   - Opens the file in text mode (default). This mode is the default mode when the `b` is not specified. Text mode treats the file contents as strings.\n",
    "   - Example: `open('file.txt', 'rt')`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each mode offers different capabilities and behaviors for interacting with files in Python. It's important to choose the appropriate mode based on the intended use case and requirements for reading from or writing to the file."

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `close()` function in Python is used to close a file object after it has been opened using the `open()` function. When you are done working with a file, it's essential to close it using the `close()` function. Here's why it's important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Management**:\n",
    "   - Closing a file releases the system resources (file descriptor) associated with that file. When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources to it, such as memory space and access to the file system. Failing to close a file may lead to resource leaks, where the resources are not released properly, potentially causing issues such as memory leaks or reaching system limits on the number of open files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Integrity**:\n",
    "   - Closing a file ensures that all data that was buffered in memory is written to the file before it is closed. When you write data to a file, it may not be immediately written to the disk; instead, it may be buffered in memory for performance reasons. Closing the file flushes any buffered data to disk, ensuring that all changes are saved properly. If you do not close the file, data may be lost if the program terminates unexpectedly or if the file is accessed by another process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **File Locking**:\n",
    "   - Closing a file releases any file locks that were acquired by the process. When a file is opened, it may be locked by the operating system to prevent other processes from modifying it simultaneously. Failing to close the file may result in the file remaining locked, preventing other processes from accessing or modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **System Limits**:\n",
    "   - Operating systems impose limits on the number of files that can be opened simultaneously by a process. Failing to close files after use may lead to reaching these limits, causing the program to fail when attempting to open additional files."

    "Q4. Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines().\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when working with files, there are multiple methods available for reading data from the file. The three commonly used methods for reading data from a file are `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`read()` Method**:\n",
    "   - The `read()` method reads the entire content of the file as a single string.\n",
    "   - If no size argument is provided, or if the size is negative or omitted, the entire file content is read.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `file.read([size])`\n",
    "   - Example:\n",

    "2. **`readline()` Method**:\n",
    "   - The `readline()` method reads a single line from the file.\n",
    "   - Each time `readline()` is called, it reads the next line from the file.\n",
    "   - When the end of the file is reached, an empty string `''` is returned.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `file.readline()`\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open file in read mode\n",
    "    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "        line1 = file.readline()\n",

    "        line2 = file.readline()\n",
    "        print(line2)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`readlines()` Method**:\n",
    "   - The `readlines()` method reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings.\n",
    "   - Each element of the list represents a single line from the file.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `file.readlines()`\n",
    "   - Example:\n",

    "        for line in lines:\n",
    "            print(line)\n",
    "\n",
    "In all these methods, the file is automatically closed after the operation is complete when using the `with` statement.

    "Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and\n",
    "open() together?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement in Python is used in conjunction with file handling operations, particularly with the `open()` function, to ensure that files are properly closed after use. When working with files, it's important to close them once you're done to release system resources and avoid potential issues such as resource leaks or file corruption. The `with` statement provides a convenient and safe way to manage file operations by automatically closing the file when the block of code inside the `with` statement completes, even if an error occurs during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using the `with` statement with `open()` for file handling operations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Resource Management**:\n",
    "   - The `with` statement ensures that the file is closed automatically once the block of code inside the `with` statement completes execution, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. This helps prevent resource leaks by releasing system resources (such as file handles) associated with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simplicity and Readability**:\n",
    "   - Using the `with` statement makes the code simpler and more readable. It clearly indicates the scope of file operations and ensures that the file is closed at the appropriate time, reducing the risk of errors and making the code easier to understand for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - The `with` statement handles exceptions gracefully. If an exception occurs during file operations, the `with` statement ensures that the file is still closed properly, preventing potential issues such as file corruption or data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Context Manager Protocol**:\n",
    "   - The `with` statement works with objects that support the context manager protocol, which includes file objects returned by the `open()` function. This allows for the creation of custom context managers for other resources, such as network connections or database connections, providing similar benefits of automatic resource management and exception handling."

    "        file.write(\"This is a test file.\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`writelines()` Function**:\n",
    "   - The `writelines()` function is used to write a list of strings to a file.\n",
    "   - Each string in the list is written to the file without adding any separator or newline character between them.\n",
